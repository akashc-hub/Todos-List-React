        Step 1: Know your goals

Your to-do list will contain the tasks you’d like to accomplish each day. Ideally, these should correlate with the milestones you’re aiming to achieve each month or quarter.

Step 2: Break down your list

Once you know where you’re heading, break down those bigger projects into smaller tasks that’ll mark your progress along the way. For example, “write essay for class” might turn into “research essay”, then “outline essay” and so on.

This will help you build momentum and chart your progress.

Step 3: Choose controllable tasks

If your to-do list consists of tasks that require other people’s input to complete them, there’s a chance you’ll never get them done. Instead, look at what you can do to increase your chances of success.

For instance, “get presentation from Julie” might become “chase Julie for presentation”. That way, you can see the actions that you’re taking.

Step 4: Prioritise your tasks

Even those of us who write our to-do list with the best of intentions don’t always achieve everything we’d hoped for each day. But we can make some small changes to improve our chances.

Place your most important tasks at the top of your to-do list. That way, you’ll come to these tasks first when you’re likely to have more energy and more motivation. The lower priority tasks can sit at the bottom of your list, to be tackled if time and space allows.

Step 5: Make it manageable

Try to be realistic about what you can accomplish in a single day. If you never complete your to-do list, your motivation is going to dwindle.

If you’re finding that you're constantly missing out on your tasks, go the other way. Write a to-do list that you’re 100% sure you can achieve. And then build up your tasks from there, bit by bit.
